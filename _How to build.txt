1. Create folder for all the repos. Call it something like 'cjs' and:

   npm i grunt-cli -g

2. git clone the EaselJS, PreloadJS, SoundJS, and TweenJS repos

3. git clone the CreateJS repo, this will put in the docs and demo info

4. Go into the Combined folder

5. npm i

6. Go into the build folder of each of EaselJS, PreloadJS, SoundsJS, and TweenJS

7. For each folder

    npm i

8. go into the Combined folder and run

    grunt build --force

    force is used because there is a grunt-sass plugin that cannot run because sass and ruby are not installed but we don't need them

9. the builds should show up in the Combined/builds folder


NOTES: copy of duplicate files overwrite Easel -> Preload -> Sound -> Tween 
i.e. Easel overwrites all
