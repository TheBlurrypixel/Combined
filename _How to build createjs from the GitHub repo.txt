1. Create folder for all the repos. Call it something like 'cjs' and:

   npm i grunt-cli -g

2. git clone the EaselJS, PreloadJS, SoundJS, and TweenJS repos

3. git clone the CreateJS repo, this will put in the docs and demo info

4. go into EaselJS/build and open the package.json

5. copy the lines from
		"grunt": "~0.4.5",
	to
		"grunt-contrib-clean":"^0.4.0",

6. go into SoundsJS/build and paste over the corresponding lines
   and delete the grunt-mxmlc line // this module corresponds to Flex which we don't need

   In the Gruntfile.js delete the line:
      grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-mxmlc');

7. Go into the Combined folder

8. npm i

9. Go into the build folder of each of EaselJS, PreloadJS, SoundsJS, and TweenJS

10. For each folder

    npm i

11. go into the Combined folder and run

    grunt build --force

    force is used because there is a grunt-sass plugin that cannot run because sass and ruby are not installed but we don't need them

12. the builds should show up in the Combined/builds folder
